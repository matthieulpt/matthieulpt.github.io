Produce an edited record of your research and a final A3 poster using only manual collage. For this project, I started from the premise that the surrealist sentence was less a message than a material. Each workshop forced me to manipulate it differently: with my hands, with the machine, with the scanner. The goal was not to obtain a “correct” result, but to see how far the sentence could be distorted while retaining its presence. I multiplied the variations to observe how each technique produced a particular aesthetic: loss of contrast, glitch, superimposition, fragmentation, etc. The edition serves to organize this experimental chaos and show its stages. As for the poster, I constructed it as a synthesis: a version where the phrase remains perceptible, but integrated into an expressive graphic composition. The whole meets the requirements through its diversity, its format, and the presence of a strong final result.",

The model takes the form of a triangular tunnel made from grey cardboard, where tearing, folding, layering, and fragmentation represent obstacles, tension, and fragility along a personal journey toward a goal. A light positioned at the end of the structure symbolizes hope, achievement, and perseverance, while the projected shadows evoke doubts, fears, and complexity. The piece creates a physical metaphor for progression through difficulty toward clarity and resolution.",
